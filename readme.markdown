## Roadmap

OK, I don't actually have a roadmap, but here are a few things I would like to support in the future:

- Denote additional monthly payments
- Denote additional one-time payments
- Estimate other monthly expenses (mortgage insurance, homeowners insurance, etc)
- Estimate other expenditures and savings (utilities, saving for capex, etc)
- Estimate closing costs
- Track forced appreciation (aka spending money to improve property value, e.g. by remodeling)
- Track estimated natural appreciation (e.g. allow an assumption that the property will appreciate by X%/year)
- Record various property facts: location, historical rent in area, historical sell price in area, etc
- Calculate ROI after certain period of time (e.g. closing costs + mortgage payments vs cash when you sell)
- Calculate COCROI (cash-on-cash ROI, aka the return on investment just off monthly cashflow, not including principal or appreciation)

Some really nice stuff might be:
- Automatically retrieve historical data about rents/sale prices in the area (from where?)
- Figure out a way to show ranges, e.g. if your mortgage broker gives you options varying in down payment size and

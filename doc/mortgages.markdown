## Interest rate vs annual percentage rate

Both rates are used to describe the cost of borrowing money.

An _interest rate_ is the cost of borrowing expressed as a percentage of the loan amount. This includes only the cost of borrowing money itself, not counting fees.

The _annual percentage rate_ (APR) is the "cost of credit, based on the the interest, fees and loan term, expressed as a yearly rate" (source: Truth In Lending Act). It includes fees, mandatory mortgage insurance, "most" closing costs, and other costs.

While the APR is useful as a comparative measure for discussing loans, most of our calculations are based on the interest rate.

Because these two terms can be confusing, we try to be very careful that variables and UI labels are correct.
